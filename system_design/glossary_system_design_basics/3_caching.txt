* Caching allows you to vastly better use the resources you have available
  and make otherwise unattainable product requirements feasible
* Principal is to use recently used things again.
    - In particular, reuse it really fast
* Used in every layer:
    - hardware, operating system, web browsers, web applications
* Caches exist in all layers of the architecture but are often found at the level
  nearest to the front end so to return data quickly so to reduce the burden of
  downstream tasks.

* Application Server Cache
    - application server has fast cache or it's own disk cache (which is faster than
      going to the DB)
    - if multiple nodes, each node could have its own caches
    - load balancing increases cache misses
        * global caches and distributed caches

* Content Delivery (Distribution) Network (CDN)
    - Need CDN cache if serving large amounts of static media
    - Request comes in -> do you have it CDN -> if not go to back end and get it
      and cache it and serve the Request
    - If small system we are building, can host a DNS static server 

* Cache Invalidation
    - Contents of storage change but cache remains the same
      --> Need to invalidate the cache
    - Write-through cache
        * Write both to cache and database simultaneously -> Complete data consistency
        * Nothing gets lost in case of a crash, power failure, system disruption.
        * 2x more expensive write operations since two writes now
    - Write-around cache
        * Write directly to permanaent storage
        * Avoid having to constantly fill cache with information that won't be used
        * Have to deal with latency of moving contents from disk to cache for recent
          write operations.
    - Write-back cache
        * Write only to cache
        * Write to database at intervals
        * If failure, will lose data if it has yet to be written to disk

* Cache enviction policies
    - FIFO (first in first out)
    - LIFO (last in first out)
    - LRU (least recently used)
    - MRU (most frequently used)
    - LFU (least frequently used)
    - RR (random replacement)
