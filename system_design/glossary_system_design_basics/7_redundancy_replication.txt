* Redundancy is the duplication of critical components of functions of a system
  with the intention of increasing the reliability of the system, usually
  in the form of a backup or failsafe, or to improve actual system performance.
    - I.E. if something goes down ... have another to replace
    - I.E. if something is being utlized a lot ... have another to offer more resoureces
* Redundancy removes single points of failure in a system. 

* Replication means sharing information to ensure consistency between redundant 
  resources, such as software or hardware componenets, to improve reliability,
  fault-tolerance, or accessibility.
* Primary server gets all updates, and then replicates that information
  on the redundant servers.
