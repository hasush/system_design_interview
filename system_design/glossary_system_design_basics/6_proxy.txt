* A proxy server is an intermediate server between the client and the 
  back-end server
* A client talks to proxy server first to request anything like a web page,
  file, connection, etc.
* Proxies are used to filter requests, log requests, or sometimes transform 
  requests (add/remove headers, encrypt/decrypt, compression)
* Proxie's cache can serve a lot of requests. 
* If many clients request something very frequenctly, then proxy server can
  serve that requests from the cache instead of having to retreive it from the
  remove server.

* Proxy server types
    - Proxy can live on client's local server or anywhere between the client
      and the remote server.
    - Open Proxy
        * A proxy server accessible by any internet user.
        * Typically a proxy server only allows users within a network
          group (i.e. a closed proxy) to store and forward internet services
          such as DNS or web pages to reduce and control the bandwidth 
          used by the group.
        * With an open proxy, however any user on the internet is able to use this
          forwarding service.
        * Anonymous Proxy
            - Go through the proxy to make it look like originating ip is from 
              the anon proxy 
        * Transparent Proxy
            - "A 'transparent proxy' is a proxy that does not modify the request 
               or response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and 
               identification"
            - Also known as an intercepting proxy, inline proxy, or forced proxy, 
              a transparent proxy intercepts normal application layer communication 
              without requiring any special client configuration. Clients need not be 
              aware of the existence of the proxy

* Reverse proxy
    - A reverse proxy retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or 
      more servers.
    - These resources are returned to the client appearing as they 
      originated from the proxy.
